Metafile Generator Sample
=========================

RUNNING
-------

Given a folder with a number of comma separated value files in it;

```
 /data/tills/trx_2017_01_05_1109.aaa.csv
 /data/tills/trx_2017_01_05_1109.aab.csv
 /data/tills/trx_2017_01_05_1109.aac.csv
 /data/tills/trx_2017_01_05_1109.aad.csv
```

Generator can be called with these parameters;

`$ generate.sh TILLS /data/tills trx_2017_01_05_1109`

and it will generate the following;

```
 /data/tills/trx_2017_01_05_1109.aaa.csv.gz
 /data/tills/trx_2017_01_05_1109.aab.csv.gz
 /data/tills/trx_2017_01_05_1109.aac.csv.gz
 /data/tills/trx_2017_01_05_1109.aad.csv.gz
 /data/tills/trx_2017_01_05_1109.meta.json
```

Which can then be uploaded to RubiKloud in that order
